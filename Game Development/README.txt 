Brief description : firstly, we need to install pygame in pycharm terminal

Secondly, project script is organized into 6 different python script.

Please run code from smaller number (ex.1_Frame.py) to larger number (2_Weapon_key_Event.py), (3_Ball_Bouncing.py)
to understand my thought process.

Run 6_Mission_Complete.py (cumulated script from 1_Frame.py to 5_Ball_Division.py).

6_Mission_Complete.pyis final version of python script in the project.


Enjoy the game!
